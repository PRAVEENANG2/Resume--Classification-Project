# Resume_Classification_project
Problem statement & Business objectives: The document classification solution should significantly reduce the manual human effort in the HRM. It should achieve a higher level of accuracy and automination with minimal human intervention.

# Abstract:
A resume is a brief summary of your skills and experience companies recruiters & HR teams have a tough time scanning thousands of Qualified resumes.spending to many labour hours segregating candidates resume's manually is a waste of a company's time,money,& productivity.

NLP technology allows a recruiters to electronically gather,store & organize large quantites of resumes. once acquried, the resume data can be easily searched through & analyzed.

The basic data analysis process performed such as data collection, text mining, data cleaning, explorarty data analysis,data visualization.

Building a machine learning model for Resume classification using python & basic Natural language processing techniques.

used python's libraries to implement various NLP techniques like tokenization,lemmatization, parts of speech tagging,etc.

A resume classification analyzes resumes data & extracts the information into the machine-readable output. it helps automatically store , organize, and analyze Resume data to find out the candidate for the particular job position and requirements.

The aim of this project is achieved by performing the various data analysis methods and using the machine learning models and Natural language processing which will help in classifying the categories of the resume and building the Resume Classification Model.

In this work, I compare different types of Machine- Learning Algorithms.

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine

K-Nearest Neighbors

Logistic Regression

Bagging Classifer

Naive Bayes

Ada Boost classifer

Gradient Boosting

All models above show the following train and test accuracy:
